		<p><strong>BMI707: Deep Learning for Biomedical Data</strong></p>
		<p>Semester: Spring 2</p>
		<p>Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that builds predictive models using large artificial neural networks. Deep learning has revolutionized the fields of computer vision, automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, and numerous areas of computational biology. In this class, we will introduce the basic concepts of deep neural networks and GPU computing, discuss convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks structures, and examine a biomedical applications. Students are expected to be familiar with linear algebra and machine learning and will participate in a group deep learning project.</p>
