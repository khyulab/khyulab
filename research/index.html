				<h2 class="editable">Machine Learning-Empowered Quantitative Pathology</h2>
				<p class="editable">We spearheaded the first fully-automated analytical workflow that extracted 9,879 quantitative features from digital whole-slide histopathology images. Whole-slide histopathology images contain billions of pixels and are difficult to process. To address this challenge, we established image processing modules to identify the regions of interest and extract features describing the size, shape, and pixel intensity distribution of the cell nuclei and cytoplasm. The extracted features from lung cancer histopathology slides successfully predicted patients’ diagnoses and prognoses. We further incorporated patients’ quantitative histopathology features with their transcriptomic profiles to identify the associations between molecular pathways and histology morphology of lung adenocarcinoma. These works lay the foundation of quantitative digital pathology analysis.</p>

				<h2 class="editable">Quantitative Pathology and Multi-Omics Data Analyses</h2>
				<p class="editable">Our early work focused on the development of bioinformatics methods for human proteome analysis. High-throughput proteomics methods generate gigabytes of raw data. To fully utilize this rich information source, we established a computational framework that integrates proteomic and genomic data to characterize the genome-proteome correlation. Using the algorithms I devised, we identified biomarkers for chemotherapy resistance in ovarian cancer patients and early stage markers for colorectal cancer. These biomarkers were validated in a separate test set not involved in the model training.</p>
