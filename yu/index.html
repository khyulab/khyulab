				<p class="editable">Kun-Hsing Yu is an Instructor in Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School. His research integrated lung cancer patients' omics (genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics) profiles with quantitative histopathology patterns to predict their clinical phenotypes. He developed a fully-automated algorithm to extract thousands of features from whole-slide histopathology images, discovered the molecular mechanisms underpinning the microscopic phenotypes of tumor cells, and successfully identified previously unknown cellular morphologies associated with patient prognosis. His research interests include quantitative pathology, machine learning, and translational bioinformatics.</p>
