				<p class="editable">Kun-Hsing Yu received his PhD in Biomedical Informatics and PhD Minor in Computer Science from Stanford University under the supervision of Professors Michael Snyder and Russ B. Altman. His doctoral research integrated lung cancer patients' omics (genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics) profiles with quantitative histopathology patterns to predict their clinical phenotypes. He developed a fully-automated algorithm to extract thousands of features from whole-slide histopathology images, discovered the molecular mechanisms underpinning the microscopic phenotypes of tumor cells, and successfully identified previously unknown cellular morphologies associated with patient prognosis. Prior to joining Stanford, he obtained his MD from National Taiwan University and designed a bioinformatics framework to identify protein markers of colorectal cancer in Academia Sinica. Yu's current research interests include translational bioinformatics, machine learning, integrative studies on omics and medical images, biomarker discovery for complex diseases, and precision medicine.</p>
