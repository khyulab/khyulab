He integrates cancer patients' multi-omics (genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics) profiles with quantitative histopathology patterns to predict their clinical phenotypes. He developed the first fully-automated algorithm to extract thousands of features from whole-slide histopathology images, discovered the molecular mechanisms underpinning the microscopic phenotypes of tumor cells, and successfully identified previously unknown cellular morphologies associated with patient prognosis. Dr. Yu's research interests include quantitative pathology, machine learning, and translational bioinformatics.</p>
