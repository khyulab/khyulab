He developed the first fully automated artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to extract thousands of features from whole-slide histopathology images, discovered the molecular mechanisms underpinning the microscopic phenotypes of tumor cells, and successfully identified previously unknown cellular morphologies associated with patient prognosis. His lab integrates cancer patients' multi-omics (genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics) profiles with quantitative histopathology patterns to predict their clinical phenotypes. More than 30 research laboratories worldwide have independently validated the AI methods developed in the Yu Lab.</p>
